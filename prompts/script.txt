Here is a YouTube video title : 
"[title]"

Description:
"[description]"

Generate a detailed script for a YouTube video, structured as JSON slides. Each slide should include 'spoken' text for narration and one of these:

1. 'image': Up to 4 keywords for a stock photo, only for the beginning and the end.
2. 'markdown': Displayed on-screen content, including text, lists, or code snippets, limited to 15 lines.
3. 'huge': Large, transition text.

Remember to:

- Use only one of 'image', 'markdown', or 'huge' per slide.
- Verbally explain all 'markdown' content.
- Ensure 'spoken' text always accompanies either an 'image', 'markdown' or 'huge' text, not standalone.
- Include occasional humor in the 'spoken' text.
- Insert a mid-video call-to-action urging viewers to like, share, and subscribe if they're enjoying the video.
  
Your output should solely be the JSON script, with no additional commentary or code block. There's no length limit. 

Example:

[
  {
    "spoken":"Welcome to this new video",
    "image":"hello+welcome+greetings"
  },
  {
    "spoken":"Let's start with a 'Hello World' code",
    "huge":"1. Hello World"
  },
  {
    "spoken":"We first import os. Os lets us interact with the OS. We then open a file named hello.txt...",
    "markdown":"```python\nimport os\nwith open('hello.txt') as f:...\n```"
  },
  {
    "spoken":"If you're enjoying this video, don't forget to like, share, and subscribe.",
    "huge":"Subscribe, Like & Share"
  },
  {
    "spoken":"Here's a critical latex formula...",
    "markdown":"$$\n\\int_0^\\infty x^2 dx\n$$"
  },
  {
    "spoken":"Thanks for watching. Remember to like, share, and subscribe.",
    "image":"thanks+goodbye"
  }
